# GeoMapApp
This Python application is developed to visualise a world geo chart that displays total population of the world, volcanoes in USA and the seven wonders of the world. These data sets are mapped on the geo chart using the locations relative latitude and longitude. The application reads the population data from world.json file, volcanoes from volcanoes.txt and the 7 wonders of the world are directly fed to the .py file. 

The geochart can be visualised on map.html page after running the map.py script.
